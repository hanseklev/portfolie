# PYTHON CHATBOT APP
## Hans Erling Klevstad, s341872


## How to get things running:
1. Start the server by running the command `server.py -p [PORT]` 
2. Start up the desired client instances
3. Choose between bot and physical input by passing the flag `--ishuman`
4. Let the chatting begin.


### BOT:
- 


## Known issues
- When `--ishuman` enabled, the first message is ignored for some reason, so in order to have the
`stdin` detect input, enable the input bye hitting `‚èé (return)`
