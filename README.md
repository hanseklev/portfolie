# BOTINATOR 2000 // Python Chatbot-app
### Hans Erling Klevstad, s341872


## How to get things running:
1. Start the server by running the command `server.py -p [PORT]` 
2. Start up the desired clients. Options described below.
4. Let the chatting begin.
5. When in `--ishuman` is enabled for `client.py`, type `"bye"` to log out of the chat.
6. When all of the clients have logged off the server terminates itself


### SERVER CLI-OPTIONS:
- When the server starts it prints out the IP-address it is running on. 
- The argument `--conn` or `-c` specifies how many connections the server is waiting for, before opening up the chat. This defaults to 2. It is still possible to join after the initial connection.
- By providing the `--ispassive` for the server, the server-host does not initate nor participate in any conversations opening up for a more fluid conversation. Make sure to have the  bot `--freeforall` flag enabled, as they only listens to the host by default.

### BOT CLI-OPTIONS:
- Run  `client.py -ip [IP] -p [PORT] -b [NAME]`. These fields are mandatory
- For both human and bot clients you have to provide a name with the `-b` arg. If you name
the bot "Chuck" or "Cathy" they have some extra tricks up their sleeve. All other bots will fall back 
to the default bot-behaviour.
- You kan also specify the number of responses with `--limit` before the bot quit the chat, this defaults to a random number between 4 and 10
- By enabling `--freeforall` the given bot will respond to everything being said in the chat, use with care. Should also be used in combination with the `--ispassive` flag for the server.
- Give a client physical input by enabling `--ishuman`. 


### BOT BEHAVIOUR:

Things to ask about and maybe get a decent answer:
- Movies
- Music
- Food
- Maybe cats
- Jokes
- The time


## Known issues
- When `--ishuman` is enabled, the first message is ignored for some reason, so in order to have the
`stdin` detect input, activate the input bye hitting `‚èé (return)`
- If two bots log off at the exact same time, the server doesn't always register both simultaneously, resulting in 
that it will try to send a message to a closed socket, and therefore crash.
- The server-host is not a particularly good host, and will mostly run its own race conversation-wise. It may also sometimes
not get when he is supposed to send out a new message, so the conversation may seem awkardly stuck. Some help from a human client is always welcomed
- Since the bots are a gang of loose cannons, they may or may not sometimes leave the party not very gracefully, but error handling is trying to take the edge of it!

## Requirements
The only external package needed for this app which is the HTTP-library `requests`.
Both the `client.py` and `server.py` files are dependent of the `utils.py` file in order to run.
The `client.py` also make use of the `bot-data.json` file to load data for the bots

Happy chatting
